        In a general sense, a conversion calculator is a tool used to convert one type of measurement or unit into another. It performs mathematical calculations to provide equivalent values in different units of measurement. Conversion calculators are used in various fields, including science, engineering, mathematics, and everyday life.Conversion calculators can be physical devices, software applications, or online tools. They are designed to simplify the process of converting measurements, making it easy for users to work with different units without having to manually perform complex calculations. Online conversion calculators are particularly popular due to their accessibility and the ability to cover a wide range of units and measurements.</p>

      <td>Scenario</td>
      <td>You are planning a trip to Europe from the United States and want to convert your U.S. Dollars (USD) to Euros (EUR).</td>
      <td>You are following a recipe that lists ingredient quantities in different units, and you need to convert them for consistency.</td>
      <td> You have a document encoded in UTF-8 and need to convert it to ASCII for compatibility with an older system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Example</td>
      <td> If the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, and you have 100 USD, the currency conversion would give you approximately 85 Euros (100 USD * 0.85 EUR/USD).</td>
      <td>If a recipe calls for 500 milliliters of milk, and you prefer using cups (1 liter = 4.22675 cups), the measurement conversion would be approximately 2.113 cups (500 ml * 0.00422675 cups/ml).</td>
      <td> If a character in UTF-8 is represented as 'é' (U+00E9), the ASCII representation might be 'e'. The character conversion ensures that the document can be correctly interpreted and processed by systems that only support ASCII encoding.</td>
